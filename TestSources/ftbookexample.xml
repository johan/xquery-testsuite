    <para>Usability is highly overrated.  My advice is similar to that
    Heinlein gave prospective authors: you must write, you must finish what
    you write, you must publish what you write.  Ship software, pay the bills.

    <para>Amazingly enough, many people believe that nunchuks are not useful
    to software development! They prefer usability studies to the swift
    application of physical means of persuasion. Hah! The ninja coder knows
    otherwise.
