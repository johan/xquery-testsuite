# XQuery and XPath Full Text 1.0 Test Suite

## What this repository is about

This page or repository is not
[the canonical home of the test suite](http://dev.w3.org/2007/xpath-full-text-10-test-suite/).
I just wanted a git-accessible
version of them to point people to,
and pieced one together with meta data
from the W3C's "release" zip files.


## Running the test suite

We encourage you,
the implementors of XQuery
and XPath Full Text 1.0,
to run these tests
and send us your results.
These results will help us
exit the Candidate Recommendation stage
(described in the [W3C Process Document](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/)).

As there is no _de jure_ or _de facto_
API for implementations of XQuery,
we are not able to provide a test harness
to execute these tests.
You will have to provide your own test harnesses.

We have provided
[Guidelines for Running the XQuery and
XPath Full Text 1.0 Test Suite](http://dev.w3.org/2007/xpath-full-text-10-test-suite/GuidelinesForRunningTheFullTextTestSuite.html)
to assist you in running these tests.
These guidelines will tell you
how the queries may be modified
before they are executed
and how to compare your actual results
with the expected results that we have provided.


## Status

This is version 1.0.4 of this test suite.
The W3C XML Query WG and the W3C XSL WG
believe that _this_ is the final version
of the test suite that will be published
before transition is requested to Proposed Recommendation.
