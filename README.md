# XQuery and XPath Full Text 1.0 Test Suite

## What this repository is about

This page or repository is not
[the canonical home of the test suite](http://dev.w3.org/2007/xpath-full-text-10-test-suite/).
I just wanted a git-accessible
version of them to point people to,
and pieced one together with meta data
from the W3C's "release" zip files.


## Status

This is version 1.0.4 of this test suite.
The W3C XML Query WG and the W3C XSL WG
believe that _this_ is the final version
of the test suite that will be published
before transition is requested to Proposed Recommendation.
