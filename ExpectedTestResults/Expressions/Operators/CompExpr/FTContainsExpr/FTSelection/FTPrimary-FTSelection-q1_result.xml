<paragraphs><p>Full-text match options modify the matching behaviour of 
the <termref def="dt-ftprimary">primary full-text selection</termref> to which 
they are applied. </p><p>
Match options are propagated through the query via the static context.
For each of the seven match option groups,
the static context has a component
that contains one option from that group.
The seven settings are initialized by the implementation
in accordance with the table in 
Appendix <specref ref="id-xqft-static-context-components"/>,
and are modified
by any <nt xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" def="doc-xquery-FTOptionDecl" xlink:type="simple">FTOptionDecl</nt>s
in the <nt xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" def="doc-xquery-Prolog" xlink:type="simple">Prolog</nt>.
The resulting settings are then propagated unchanged
to every <nt xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" def="doc-xquery-FTContainsExpr" xlink:type="simple">FTContainsExpr</nt> in the module
(including those in <code>VarDecl</code>s and <code>FunctionDecl</code>s,
and including any that happen to be nested within
another <code>FTContainsExpr</code>).
At any given <code>FTContainsExpr</code>,
the settings from the static context
are copied to the <code>FTContainsExpr</code>'s inner settings,
which are then propagated down the syntax tree.
At each <nt xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" def="doc-xquery-FTPrimaryWithOptions" xlink:type="simple">FTPrimaryWithOptions</nt>,
the locally specified match options (if any)
overwrite the corresponding inner setting(s).
At each <nt xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" def="doc-xquery-FTWords" xlink:type="simple">FTWords</nt>,
the inner settings are used
as the effective match options
for tokenizing the query strings
and matching them against the tokens in the text.
(These inner settings could be seen
as a parallel set of components in the static context,
but Section <specref ref="tq-semantics"/> models them
as structures that get passed as parameters
to various semantic functions.)
