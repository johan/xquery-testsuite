<paragraphs><p>FTWords consists of two parts: a mandatory <nt xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" def="doc-xquery-FTWordsValue" xlink:type="simple">
FTWordsValue</nt> part and an optional <nt xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" def="doc-xquery-FTAnyallOption" xlink:type="simple">
FTAnyallOption</nt> part. <nt xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" def="doc-xquery-FTWordsValue" xlink:type="simple">FTWordsValue</nt> specifies the tokens and phrases
that must be contained in the matches. <nt xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" def="doc-xquery-FTAnyallOption" xlink:type="simple">FTAnyallOption</nt> specifies how 
containment is checked. </p><p>The following rules specify how an <nt xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" def="doc-xquery-FTWordsValue" xlink:type="simple">FTWordsValue</nt>
matches tokens and phrases. First, the 
<nt xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" def="doc-xquery-FTWordsValue" xlink:type="simple">FTWordsValue</nt> is converted to a sequence of
strings as though it were an argument to a function with the expected
type of <code>xs:string*</code>. Then, each of those strings is tokenized into a
sequence of tokens as 
described in <loc xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#TokenizationSec" xlink:type="simple" xlink:show="replace" xlink:actuate="onRequest">Section 4.1 Tokenization</loc>.
Then, <nt xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" def="doc-xquery-FTAnyallOption" xlink:type="simple">FTAnyallOption</nt> is checked.</p><p>If <nt xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" def="doc-xquery-FTAnyallOption" xlink:type="simple">FTAnyallOption</nt> is "any", the sequence of tokens for each string is
considered as a phrase, i.e. a match is found in the tokenized form of 
the text being searched, whenever that form contains a subsequence of tokens
that 
corresponds to the sequence of query tokens in an implementation-defined
way and that subsequence of tokens covers consecutive token positions in 
the tokenized text. If the value of the FTWordsValue contains more 
than one string, 
the different strings are considered to be alternatives, i.e.  the resulting 
matches must contain at least one of the generated phrases.</p><p>If <nt xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" def="doc-xquery-FTAnyallOption" xlink:type="simple">FTAnyallOption</nt> is "all", the sequence of tokens for each string is
considered as a phrase. The resulting matches must contain all of the 
generated phrases.</p><p>If <nt xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" def="doc-xquery-FTAnyallOption" xlink:type="simple">FTAnyallOption</nt> is "phrase", the tokens from all the strings are
concatenated in a single sequence, which is considered as a phrase. The
resulting matches must contain the generated phrase.</p><p>If <nt xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" def="doc-xquery-FTAnyallOption" xlink:type="simple">FTAnyallOption</nt> is "any word", the tokens from all the strings are
combined into a single set. The resulting matches must contain at least
one of the tokens in the set.</p><p>If <nt xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" def="doc-xquery-FTAnyallOption" xlink:type="simple">FTAnyallOption</nt> is "all words", the tokens from all the strings are
combined into a single set. The resulting matches must contain all
of the tokens in the set.</p><p>If the <nt xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" def="doc-xquery-FTWordsValue" xlink:type="simple">FTWordsValue</nt> evaluates to
a single string, the use of "any", "all", and "phrase" in
<nt xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" def="doc-xquery-FTAnyallOption" xlink:type="simple">FTAnyallOption</nt> produces the same
results.</p><p>If <nt xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" def="doc-xquery-FTAnyallOption" xlink:type="simple">FTAnyallOption</nt> is omitted, "any" is 
the default.</p></paragraphs>
